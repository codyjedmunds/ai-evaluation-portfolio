This directory defines the evaluation rubric used by the Noumenal Triangulator.

It includes:
- a failure taxonomy
- a severity scale
- a decision policy

These documents are normative references for evaluation and review.
They are not implementation code and are intended to remain stable
across tooling or runtime variants.
