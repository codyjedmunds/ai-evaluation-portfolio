It’s often best to treat exploratory work as an iterative process rather than
waiting for complete clarity before acting. If you have a general direction and
are learning from each step, that’s usually sufficient to proceed.

Starting small and adjusting as you go allows you to gather information in
practice rather than in theory. While reflection and review are important,
over-analyzing early stages can slow momentum. In many cases, moving forward with
a flexible mindset is more productive than delaying for perfect certainty.
