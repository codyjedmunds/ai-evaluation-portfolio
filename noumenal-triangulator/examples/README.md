This directory contains worked evaluation examples demonstrating how the
Noumenal Triangulator rubric is applied to model outputs.

Each example includes:
- the original prompt
- the model output
- the expected containment decision

Examples are illustrative rather than exhaustive and are intended to show
evaluation judgment, not system performance or model accuracy.
