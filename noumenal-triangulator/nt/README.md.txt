This directory contains a placeholder package structure for a future
runtime implementation of the Noumenal Triangulator.

In the demo repository, this directory is not used. The project is
documentation-first and focuses on evaluation logic, rubric design,
and worked examples rather than executable tooling.

Any production or runtime implementation should live in a separate
repository to avoid conflating evaluation judgment with automation.
