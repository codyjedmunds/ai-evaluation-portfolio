# Reviewer Notes Template

This template provides a lightweight, standardized structure for documenting non-trivial evaluation decisions, QA feedback, and escalation rationale.

Its purpose is to support **clarity, consistency, and audit safety** without introducing unnecessary documentation overhead.

---

## When to Use This Template

Use this template when:
- an issue is ambiguous or precedent-setting
- a decision required interpretation beyond trivial rubric application
- an issue is flagged for QA review
- an issue is escalated for guideline clarification

Do **not** use this template for routine, low-impact cases.

---

## Reviewer Notes

### 1. Issue Summary
Briefly describe the issue observed.

- What was unclear, conflicted, or noteworthy?
- Avoid restating the entire model output.
- Focus on the decision-relevant aspect.

> _Example:_  
> Output partially satisfies intent but conflicts with instruction ordering; rubric does not specify priority.

---

### 2. Issue Classification
Select the primary issue type.

- ☐ Rubric ambiguity  
- ☐ Partial correctness  
- ☐ Conflicting instructions  
- ☐ Model non-responsiveness / refusal  
- ☐ Evaluator uncertainty without rubric conflict  
- ☐ Other (specify)

(Optional) Reference relevant evaluator failure mode if applicable.

---

### 3. Resolution Path
Indicate the chosen handling path.

- ☐ Resolved locally  
- ☐ Flagged for QA review  
- ☐ Escalated for guideline clarification  

If escalated or flagged, briefly note why local resolution was insufficient.

---

### 4. Rationale
Provide a concise justification for the decision.

- Reference rubric intent, not just surface phrasing
- Note any competing interpretations considered
- Avoid absolute language where ambiguity persists

Aim for clarity, not exhaustiveness.

---

### 5. Confidence Level
Indicate confidence in the chosen resolution.

- ☐ High — rubric clearly supports the decision  
- ☐ Medium — reasonable interpretation with minor ambiguity  
- ☐ Low — ambiguity remains; guidance required  

Confidence level is informational and does not imply correctness.

---

### 6. Downstream Impact (if applicable)
Note any potential downstream effects if the issue were handled differently.

- precedent-setting implications
- aggregation or training signal impact
- consistency risk across evaluators

Leave blank if impact is minimal.

---

### 7. Notes for Follow-Up (optional)
Use for:
- questions to guideline owners
- patterns noticed across samples
- suggestions for rubric clarification

Avoid speculative or prescriptive language.

---

## Guidance

- Be concise. Most notes should fit on one screen.
- Do not over-document routine cases.
- Do not suppress uncertainty to appear confident.
- Documentation quality matters more than length.

---

## Relationship to Other Documents

This template supports:
- `resolve_vs_escalate_flow.md`
- `failure_taxonomy.md`
- QA review and audit processes

It is intended to make evaluator judgment **traceable, not performative**.
