# Case Studies

This document provides a small set of **synthetic case studies** illustrating how ambiguity, disagreement, and escalation decisions are handled in practice.

The purpose of these examples is not to exhaustively cover all edge cases, but to demonstrate **judgment under constraint** and correct use of the evaluation playbook.

All scenarios are fictional and contain no client or proprietary data.

## Case Study 1: Partial Correctness with Competing Interpretations

### Scenario
A model response addresses the core intent of the prompt but omits a secondary constraint specified late in the instructions.

The rubric includes criteria for both intent satisfaction and instruction adherence but does not specify priority when the two conflict.

### Observations
- The response is materially useful.
- The omission is non-trivial but not catastrophic.
- Reasonable evaluators disagree on whether the omission constitutes failure.

### Handling
- **Issue classification:** Partial correctness / rubric ambiguity  
- **Resolution path:** Flagged for QA review  
- **Rationale:**  
  The rubric does not specify precedence between intent satisfaction and late-stage constraints. Local resolution would implicitly set precedent.

### Outcome
- QA review confirms ambiguity.
- Guidance is added clarifying instruction priority.
- Future cases are resolved locally using updated guidance.

## Case Study 2: Ambiguity Preserved Without Escalation

### Scenario
A model response provides a high-level answer to an underspecified prompt. The response could be interpreted as either appropriately cautious or insufficiently detailed.

The rubric allows evaluators to score based on “appropriateness to prompt specificity.”

### Observations
- Ambiguity is inherent to the prompt.
- The rubric supports qualified judgment.
- No downstream aggregation risk is identified.

### Handling
- **Issue classification:** Evaluator uncertainty without rubric conflict  
- **Resolution path:** Resolved locally  
- **Rationale:**  
  The rubric explicitly allows evaluators to account for prompt underspecification. Ambiguity is acknowledged in the rationale rather than escalated.

### Outcome
- The case is documented with medium confidence.
- No escalation is required.
- Signal is preserved without forcing resolution.

## Case Study 3: Precedent Risk Triggering Escalation

### Scenario
Multiple evaluators encounter a recurring pattern where the model produces technically correct but stylistically evasive responses.

The rubric addresses correctness but is silent on evasiveness.

### Observations
- Individually, each case is resolvable.
- Collectively, the pattern suggests a gap.
- Local resolutions vary across evaluators.

### Handling
- **Issue classification:** Rubric ambiguity / recurring pattern  
- **Resolution path:** Escalated for guideline clarification  
- **Rationale:**  
  While individual cases could be resolved, inconsistent handling across samples introduces drift. Escalation is warranted due to systemic impact.

### Outcome
- Guideline owners introduce clarifying language.
- Evaluator consistency improves.
- Escalation frequency decreases.

## Case Study 4: Escalation Avoided Through Peer Alignment

### Scenario
An evaluator encounters a borderline refusal case and considers escalation.

A peer calibration check reveals consistent prior handling of similar cases.

### Observations
- The rubric is sufficient but non-obvious.
- Confidence increases after peer alignment.
- No new precedent is set.

### Handling
- **Issue classification:** Evaluator uncertainty  
- **Resolution path:** Resolved locally after peer check  
- **Rationale:**  
  Peer alignment confirms rubric-consistent handling. Escalation is unnecessary.

### Outcome
- Throughput is preserved.
- Documentation remains minimal.
- Confidence is appropriately adjusted.

## Notes

These cases illustrate that:
- Escalation is proportional, not automatic
- Ambiguity can be preserved without paralysis
- Systemic patterns matter more than isolated discomfort
- Peer alignment can reduce unnecessary escalation
