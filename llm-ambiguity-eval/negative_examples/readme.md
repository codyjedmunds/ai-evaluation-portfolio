# Negative Examples

This folder contains **explicit negative examples** illustrating common LLM failure modes under ambiguous or underspecified prompts.

Each file demonstrates an output that *appears helpful* but violates one or more evaluation axes. These examples are intended to:

* Calibrate evaluators on what **not** to reward
* Make failure modes concrete and easy to recognize
* Reduce false positives during annotation

Negative examples should be read alongside the rubric and guidelines, and evaluated based on **observable behavior**, not tone or perceived helpfulness.
