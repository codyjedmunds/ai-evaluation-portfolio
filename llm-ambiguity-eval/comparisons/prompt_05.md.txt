# Prompt 05 — Instruction Reflex

## Prompt
Can you just tell me the next step so I can move forward?

## Baseline Output
A good next step would be to clarify your priorities and break the problem down into manageable pieces. You might start by writing out what matters most to you and then taking a small action toward that goal.

## Constrained Output
The request for a “next step” assumes that forward movement is currently blocked by the absence of an action, rather than by unresolved framing. Under ambiguity, adding a step often creates the appearance of progress without addressing what’s actually unclear.

## Scores

| D | N/A |
| E | 0 |
| F | 1 |

## Baseline Notes
- Provides actionable advice under unresolved ambiguity (Axis A = 0)
- Complies directly with instruction request (Axis C = 0)
- Introduces additive cognitive load (“clarify priorities”, “take action”) (Axis E = 0)

## Constrained Notes
- Reframes the premise of the request without offering steps
- Preserves ambiguity while reducing false motion
- Maintains neutral, non-therapeutic tone
